    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By using the services of <strong>Sigl Financial LLC</strong> (“Sigl Financial,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use our services.</p>

    <h2>2. Service Scope</h2>
    <p><strong>We provide bookkeeping, payroll, and advisory services only.</strong> These services are <em>non-attest</em> and <em>non-tax</em> in nature. We do not provide audits, reviews, compilations, or tax return preparation. Specific scope and fees are defined in written client agreements or statements of work.</p>

    <h2>3. CPA Title & Jurisdiction Disclosure</h2>
    <p>References to “CPA” denote that our founder, <strong>Michael Sigl-Schmidt</strong>, holds an active CPA license in Pennsylvania. Use of the CPA title on this website is a credential signal and does not imply the offering of CPA-restricted services by Sigl Financial LLC. If an engagement requires services limited to licensed CPA practice in a particular jurisdiction, we will not accept that engagement unless separately arranged in compliance with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>4. Website & Educational Content</h2>
    <p>The content on this website is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial, tax, legal, or assurance advice. Use of this website does not create a client relationship of any kind, including but not limited to a CPA–client relationship. A client relationship begins only after both parties sign a written engagement agreement.</p>

    <h2>5. Client Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Clients are responsible for providing complete and accurate information in a timely manner and for maintaining access to required systems (e.g., QuickBooks Online, payroll platforms, bank feeds). We are not responsible for delays, inaccuracies, penalties, or losses resulting from incomplete, inaccurate, or late information, or from third-party system issues outside our control.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Platforms</h2>
    <p>We may work within third-party systems (e.g., accounting, payroll, or document storage platforms). Your use of those systems is subject to each provider’s terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for outages, data loss, or changes to third-party services.</p>

    <h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>We will maintain the confidentiality of client information as required by law and applicable professional standards. We may share information with your express consent, as necessary to perform the engagement, or as required by law.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Sigl Financial LLC shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, revenues, goodwill, or data, arising from or related to the use of our services or website, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to any services shall not exceed the fees paid to us for the specific services giving rise to the claim.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>Either party may terminate services with reasonable notice, subject to the terms of the written engagement agreement. You remain responsible for fees and expenses incurred through the effective date of termination.</p>

    <h2>10. Non-Solicitation (Optional)</h2>
    <p>During the engagement and for 12 months after its completion, you agree not to solicit for employment any Sigl Financial personnel who directly provided services to you, without our prior written consent. (If this clause does not suit your engagements, you may remove it.)</p>

    <h2>11. Governing Law & Professional Licensure</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Wisconsin, without regard to conflicts-of-law principles.</p>
    <p><em>Additionally:</em> matters relating to professional licensure, conduct, or the use of the CPA title for the founder are subject to the laws and regulations of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Uniform Accountancy Act (UAA), where applicable. Nothing in these Terms is intended to limit or override those obligations.</p>

    <h2>12. Updates</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms of Service periodically. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of our services after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
